# MusicGameTrainer

## Introduction

this is a training tool to practice the music game.

The purpose of training can be achieved by repeatedly watching a video on your phone and typing it with your finger (on
a computer, you can repeatedly tap the keyboard according to the slowed-down video).

~~(Hey, it's not you who are cleaning the glass)~~



> Currently the App supports Android, Windows, Linux, and theoretically can be adapted to macOS. ~~(Without rice, it
cannot be adapted to IOS)~~



> # Note
>
> Before using it on a computer, please install `VLC Player` in advance, otherwise the video will not play properly!
